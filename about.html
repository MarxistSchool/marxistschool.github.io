    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    
    <p>Every generation struggles in its own way against the social problems of their time. They struggle in the material ways available to them and 
      with the tools they have to build power. Marxism is a significant tool that empowers people with a concrete analysis of concrete things. 
      The purpose of the Marxist School is to strengthen the class consciousness of the lower classes in the community with tools to help analyze, 
      organize, and resist systems of oppression. </p>
      
      <p><strong>We struggle together to win together</strong></p>

    <p>Marxism has a complex history in the US being an important intersectional class perspective in movements of liberation, civil rights, 
      feminism, labor unions, and international solidarity. These movements had a material analysis of capitalism, a vision for economic democracy, 
      and effective strategies for social change that were informed by a Marxist analysis and their lived experience. The relationship people in the 
      US today have to these tools and perspectives have been warped and washed in such a way that has disconnected them from a critical analysis. 
      The Marxist School of Sacramento will rebuild these connections between their own history of social movements in the US, their relationship 
      to the economy, and a grounded model for how the world works.</p>

    <p>Founded in May, 2000 with a lecture by Michael Parenti, the Marxist School has sponsored book readings, discussion groups, monthly speakers, 
      and ongoing classes. We have no “litmus” test for what makes a Marxist, nor do we ask our participants to identify themselves as Marxists; 
      we only ask for a willingness to engage in discourse. Our only requirement is that our lecturers identify as Marxists according to their own definition.</p>

    <p>All events at the Marxist School of Sacramento are free and open to the public. We rely entirely on voluntary donations to pay for our room rentals, 
      copying, and mailing costs. The Marxist School is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, ID Number 94-3368431 and donations to The Marxist School of 
      Sacramento are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. Contact us at <a href="mailto:MarxistSchool@gmail.com">MarxistSchool@gmail.com</a></p>  </main>
